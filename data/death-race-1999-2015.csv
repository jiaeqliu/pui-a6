"1. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:",,,,,,,

2. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the,,,,,,,
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis",,,,,,,
of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin,,,,,,,
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:",,,,,,,
